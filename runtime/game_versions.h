// The game versions Savage Wind knows, by the build id of their main module (its first 8 bytes as hex, as
// tools/sw_probe.py prints it). The configuration screen sets up the supported ones; a known one that isn't supported
// yet is refused with its own message. tools/game_sites.py VERSIONS is the same list for the code generator
// (tools/test_game_sites.py checks they match); docs/SAVAGE-WIND.md, "Versiones del juego", has the steps for a
// new version. X(version, build id, supported, RomFS files)
// RomFS files: how many its RomFS has with the update applied over the base game (0: not counted). Before copying, the
// setup checks that the chosen RomFS says this version in System/Version.txt and has at least 95% of these files: the
// cartridge's RomFS without the update says its own version, the update's RomFS alone has far fewer files
// (runtime/ui/launcher.mm, check_romfs).
